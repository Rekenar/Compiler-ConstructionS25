(a) 
Define a regular expression describing block comments that start with “/*” and end with “*/” 
(/*...*/). You may assume  that block comments are not nested (i.e. /*.../*...*/...*/ does 
not occur in input). You may use the terminal symbol char for any character that is neither ‘/’ nor 
‘*’.

/\* ([^*] | \*(?!/) )*  \*/


The asterisks need to be escaped so that they are seen as a character and not a command using the backslash "\"


/\*  For beginning of comment "/*".

[^*] For any character that is not an asterisk "*"

| or

\*(?!/) For any asterisk that is not followed by an "/" Wikipedia

\*/  For ending of comment "*/"



(b) Can nested block comments be described by a regular expression? Explain your answer.


Since regular expressions are an alternative notation for regular grammars and regular grammars cannot handle nested structures, they cannot describe nested block comments.
